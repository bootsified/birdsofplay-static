					<p>Hi&nbsp;guys,</p>
					<p>It doesn't look like the weather is going to cooperate for practice today. Enjoy the bye week, stay dry,
						and see you next week. If you are looking for some soccer to watch in the meantime, I'd recommend the Man
						Utd-Arsenal match on&nbsp;Sunday.</p>

						<small>posted by Coach Aaron – <span class="no-wrap">Mon, April 24th, 2017 @ 2:12pm</span></small>
					</p>
					<p>Hi&nbsp;Birds,</p>
					<p>Due to Mata's Show-Me-Night, we won't be able to practice on Wednesday. And unfortunately, I don't really
						have another free night this week, except Friday. But we have a 9am game Saturday so that seems ill-advised.
						Unfortunately that means no practice this week. We can go ahead and practice next week to make up for it,
						even though we have no game the following Saturday. Sound&nbsp;good?
					</p>
					<p>To recap the rest of the season:<br></p>
					<p>4/26: <strong>No practice</strong><br>4/29: Game at 9am (Field 8)<br>5/3: Practice<br>5/6: No game<br>5/10:
						Practice<br>5/13: Double-header (10 &amp; 11am) and probably pictures as well<br>5/?: Team
						get-together/party?<br>5/20: No game scheduled, but stay tuned for rain makeup&nbsp;announcements</p>
					<p>Thanks,</p>

					<p>Hi&nbsp;guys,</p>
					<p>Both Hugh and I are sick unfortunately so I am going to go ahead and cancel practice. I was hoping to do a
						full scrimmage this week, but we will have to push that to next week. In my absence, feel free to meet up
						anyway and kick the ball around. Or there are 3 great UEFA champions league matches this afternoon if you
						want to get your fix that&nbsp;way.</p>
					<p>Anyway, sorry for the short notice and I look forward to seeing everyone this&nbsp;weekend.</p>

					<p>Hi&nbsp;all,</p>
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>Hope everyone had a great Spring Break. As we have such a long break, I thought we might still have

					<p>For anyone that can make it, let's meet at the usual place and time. (Lake Highlands Park, Wed at&nbsp;6pm)

					<p>Uniforms will be ready on Friday. It took some teeth-pulling at Rebel Riot to get the order finalized. In
						the meantime, Not Just Soccer in Highland Park is putting together black short/black sock combos for us.
						Costs for things are as&nbsp;follows:</p>
					<p>Shirts: $13 (both adult and youth)<br>Short/sock combo: $20<br>Total for each kid: $33<br>Total for each
						adult shirt: $13<br>Please pay me as soon as possible via either Paypal or Venmo. If using Paypal, please
						select "personal&nbsp;payment"</p>
					<p>If you'd prefer to get your own socks and shorts, or already have them, please let me know by the end of
						the&nbsp;day.</p>
					<p>Also, as of right now, I only have 2 people ordering adult shirts -- please let me know if anyone else
						wants one - I think I can add more to the order by the end of the day. They look like&nbsp;this:</p>

					<p class="post-head">Birds of Play Soccer&nbsp;Update<br>
						<small>posted by Coach Aaron – <span class="no-wrap">Tue, February 28th, 2017 @ 4:30am</span></small>
					</p>
					<p>Hi&nbsp;all,
					</p>
					<p>The season is upon us! Here are a few items to take note&nbsp;of:</p>
					<p><strong>Uniforms</strong><br>There is a really cool screenprinting shop on NW Hwy at Easton (Rebel Riot)
						that is giving me pricing on screenprinted Birds of Play t-shirts. It is looking like 4-color will be too
						expensive, so I am going to go with a black shirt with a white logo (similar to attached). They can also do
						these as adult shirt, so if any adults want a team shirt for themselves, let me know. I will also need you
						to send over your players' t-shirt sizes ASAP. I will be getting pricing very soon and then I will send out
						a request for PayPal or Venmo $$. We will also wear some black shorts and black-and-white striped socks. I
						will have details on those&nbsp;soon.</p>
					<p><strong>Skills Camp</strong><br>This Saturday the YMCA is hosting a skills camp for all league players. It
						will be at Randall Park from 11:30-12:30. It's not really a team event (all kids are just in one big group)
						but Hugh and I went last year and it was worthwhile to introduce your kids to the basics (or
						refresh&nbsp;them).</p>
					<p><strong>First Actual Practice</strong><br>Our first team practice will be next Wednesday (3/8) at Lake
						Highlands Park at 6pm. Please bring a ball and have your kiddo wear cleats and shin guards. Kindergartners
						use size 3&nbsp;balls.</p>
					<p><strong>Roster</strong><br>Our roster is now complete, with 11 players. Anyone whom I previously contacted
						about not being listed with us can now put any concerns to rest -- we are all squared&nbsp;away.</p>
					<p><strong>First Game</strong><br>Our first game should be on March 11, but time is TBD, as the YMCA hasn't
						released the schedule&nbsp;yet.</p>
					<p><strong>Help</strong><br>Lastly, please let me know if you are able to help with 1) snack coordination, 2)
						sideline/subbing help during game, or 3) practice assistance. It sometimes takes a few voices to
						herd&nbsp;Kindergartners.</p>
					<p>Thanks! Please let me know if you have any&nbsp;questions.</p>

						<small>posted by Coach Aaron – <span class="no-wrap">Thu, February 23rd, 2017 @ 4:00pm</span></small>
					</p>
					<p>Hi&nbsp;all,</p>
					<p>Sorry for the long gap since the last update -- I am still trying to get a hold of the YMCA. They either
						haven't sent out rosters yet or they just aren't getting back to me. I will keep nagging them. For what it's
						worth, the game schedule isn't out yet, so maybe they are just moving&nbsp;slowly.</p>
					<p>One exciting bit of news is that we have a graphic designer parent on the team! He put together the
						attached mockup for a team theme that celebrates both of our schools and our bird mascots. I am looking at
						options right now for getting this printed and I will have more on that&nbsp;soon.</p>

					<p class="post-head">Spring&nbsp;Soccer<br>
						<small>posted by Coach Aaron – <span class="no-wrap">Wed, February 8th, 2017 @ 4:00pm</span></small>
					</p>
					<p>Hello&nbsp;all,</p>
					<p>Looks like we've got a dynamite team together. I'm excited to have some old faces and some new. Here are a
						few initial&nbsp;details:</p>
					<p><strong>Registration</strong><br>If you haven't yet, please register on the White Rock YMCA website (or in
						person) and Coach Aaron Hobbins down as the team name. -- deadline is this&nbsp;Friday.</p>
					<p><strong>Season schedule</strong><br>Game schedule isn't out yet, but the season runs from March
						4-May&nbsp;13</p>
					<p><strong>Practices</strong><br>Practices will be each Wednesday prior to Saturday games (if there's no game
						that week, there's no practice that week). We'll meet at 6pm and will practice for about 30 minutes. Hexter
						is reserved for YMCA use but teams can't make individual reservations and it gets crowded. My preference
						would be to practice at Lake Highlands Park just down the street from Hexter. The drawback there is that we
						can only reserve it two weeks at a time. I am looking into other options, but tentatively I would like to
						take our chances on Lake Highlands&nbsp;Park.</p>
					<p><strong>Uniforms</strong><br>We're going to be opting for a t-shirt with a logo on it this time. I will get
						this ball rolling shortly and let everyone&nbsp;know.</p>
					<p><strong>Mascot/Team Name</strong><br>We're a hybrid school team so I don't want to use Eagles or Hawks. If
						you have any creative, non-trademarked ideas, please send them my way, and I'll pick 3 to send out to you
						all for a&nbsp;vote. </p>
					<p>Thanks,</p>
					<p>Aaron</p>
